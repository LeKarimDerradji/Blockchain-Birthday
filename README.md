The current Smart Contract is a School Project : 
What is asked is to write a smart contract with two three major functionalities,                                                                                                                                        
first of all, it is to be able, for some given friends, To deposit their money inside that piggy bank is the second functionality,
the smart contract will lock the function that serves to withdraw all the funds. This will be done until the birthday of a given recipient is met. 
Now, one problem remains, who should be in charge ? Let's say that the recipient dies before attaining their birthday ? 
Working with time in solidity requires more checks, since nothing is trully certains, I will then implements that.
